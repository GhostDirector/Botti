Alrighty then, I'll just head out. Alone. By myself. Into the dangerous wastes.
You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
Boss, I got a poison situation here!
You know those little lead things that fly really fast and hurt people? I need some.
This armor's probably fine. The holes are cosmetic.
That's sounding dangerously close to a plan, boss.
Sure, boss. I'd be happy to prolong my captivity and psychological abuse to tighten some lug nuts for you.
Sure, I'll just pull a toolbox out from behind a conveniently-placed rock and get to work.
I'm sure that was a cleverly-planned act, boss, and not just random psychosis.
Oh, good, the boss is murdering people now. Excellent.
Hey boss, is my jaw still attached? Good. Can I get some help to keep it that way?
And then, of course, the radiation started to kick in, turning me into this handsome devil you see before you.
Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
Sure, I'll stop using my rather effective gun and switch to, ah, this piece of metal tubing here. Great plan, boss.
Uh, hate to criticize boss, but I'm not actually immortal. Just old.
Angry soldier robots with bazookas. I'm sure they'll be a good police force.
Don't worry, boss. I'll make sure your biography says you "heroically changed your mind" about killing the president, not "choked under pressure."
