Alrighty then, I'll just head out. Alone. By myself. Into the dangerous wastes.
You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
